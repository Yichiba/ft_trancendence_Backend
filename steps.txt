1. Design the Friend System (Data Modeling):
Friend Requests: Decide how friendships will be formed. Typically, this involves a system where a user sends a friend request, and the other user accepts it.
Database Structure: You’ll need tables or models to represent users and their friendships.
Users Table: Store basic user information (ID, name, etc.).
Friends Table (Many-to-Many): A table linking users to each other to represent friendships.
Friend Requests Table (Optional): If you want to handle pending friend requests, create a table for pending/accepted requests with statuses (e.g., "pending", "accepted").

2. Create Friend Request and Accept Mechanism:
Friend Request: Allow users to send a friend request to another user. This could be handled by sending the target user’s ID and storing the pending request in the database.
Accept/Reject Friend Request: Once a user receives a friend request, they should be able to accept or reject it. Once accepted, the friendship should be stored in the Friends table.


3. Backend API Endpoints:
Send Friend Request (POST): An API endpoint where a user can send a friend request to another user.
Accept Friend Request (POST/PUT): An endpoint to accept a pending friend request.
View Friends List (GET): A method to get a list of friends for the current user.
Remove Friend (DELETE): An option for users to remove a friend from their list.


4. Update Views/Front-End:
Friendship UI: You’ll need a user interface that allows users to search for other users, send friend requests, view pending requests, and see their list of friends.
Notifications: Provide feedback or notifications when a friend request is sent, received, or accepted.


5. Real-Time Features (Optional):
If you want real-time updates (e.g., when a friend request is received or accepted), consider using WebSockets or a framework like Django Channels for real-time communication between users.

6. Connection Logic (Bluetooth Integration):
Since you are building a Bluetooth-based game connection platform:
Once the friendship is established, implement a way for users to connect over Bluetooth.
When users are friends, enable the option to connect directly using Bluetooth and start a game session without Wi-Fi.
This would involve having APIs to manage friendships and establishing Bluetooth connections between paired devices at the game level.

Is there a specific part of this process you'd like to focus on first?
